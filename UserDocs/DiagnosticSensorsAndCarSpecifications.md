# 1.2 Diagnostic Sensors & Car Specifications

## Diagnostic Sensors
The Metaverse Maintenance system uses the OBDII port to measure built-in sensor data of an automotive. Although the make and model of a vehichle will determine the specific sensors availible for reading, Metaverse Maintenance uses a predefined list of sensors that can be found in the majority of the vehichles on the market today. 

The following sensors are read via the OBDII port:

### Diagnostic Sensors
- Absolute Load
- Barometric Pressure
- Control Module Voltage
- Engine Load
- Evaporative Purge
- Maintenance Indicator Light
- Revolutions Per Minute (RPM)
- Run Time
- Speed
- Throttle Position
- Timing Advance

The following values are calculated via user-input and diagnostic sensor values:

### Calculated Values
- Air Filter
- Battery
- Cabin Air Filter
- Oil Filter

## Car Specifications
There are 2 main specifications for vehichles using the Metaverse Maintenance system: OBDII connectivity and power output.

- OBDII connectivity: The OBDII port was legally mandated for cars and trucks manufactured after 1996. Vehiichles without this port will not be able to utilize the system.
- Power output: The in-car dashboard requires a 12V USB power source. For vehichles with an insufficient power output, an [adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B092TXDJZX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) may need to be purchased.
