# 5.6 Replacing Parts

Metaverse Maintenance keeps track of attribute data that is not directly read through the OBD sensors:

### Calculated Values
- Air Filter
- Battery
- Cabin Air Filter
- Oil Filter

These values are measured in miles-driven-since-replaced and are calculated based upon the speed and location data of the car. The Noda interface offers a user the ability to mark these parts as replaced when appropriate.

To mark a part as replaced, select the node of the sensor using the "A" button on the right controller.

The name of the attribute will be placed in the "Title" box of the web browser. Next, simply select "Mark as Replaced" to replace the part.

To confirm the part has been replaced, go to either the Real Time Overview or Historical Overview. The value of the attribute should now be 0.
