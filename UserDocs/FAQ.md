# 6.1 FAQ

This report documents frequently asked questions by users of the Metaverse Maintenance system.

- 1) Do I need a VR headset?
 
 No. No VR headset is required to use Metaverse Maintenance. The web application can be accessed from any browser on a connected device. 
 
- 2) What VR headsets work with Metaverse Maintenance?

Many! Any VR headset that is compatible with Noda will work for Metaverse Maintenance.

- 3) Do I need to purchase a Noda Core or Noda Plus?

Yes. Due to API restrictions, the core version of Noda is required to import vehicle data into Noda. This consists of a separate one-time $30 purchase, and a $5 monthly subscription for Noda Plus.

- 4) Do I need to do anything for the OBDII device and in-car display to work properly?

The only thing that needs to be done is for both devices to be plugged in fully. The OBDII device is operational with the red LED indicator turned on. The in-car monitor is operational with DC power supplied to its power input.

- 5) The monitor is not displaying current data properly. What should I do?

If the monitor is not displaying data properly, there could be a communication issue between the car and the OBDII port or between the OBDII port and the monitor. There are LEDs on the OBDII port indicating communication. If the LEDs are not lighting up, this would indicate a communication error. Try disconnecting both devices and reconnecting them to reestablish communication. If that does not work, the OBDII device or monitor could be defective.
