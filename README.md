## Project Abstract
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a device capable of reading On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) data from a vehicle, displaying real-time critical values to a driver, and storing that data for later use and analysis within a virtual environment. The device will utilize the mandated OBD port within modern vehicles to collect and send data through Bluetooth connections. A Raspberry Pi and connected graphical user interface (GUI) will display real-time data within the vehicle. This data will then be sent through the attached modem to a cloud-based IOT platform allowing for analysis to improve vehicle life and performance
